# pulling back from the brink

Lately I find myself tempted by darkness. It beckons to me, whispering sweetly in my ear.  
*write in all lowercase*, it says.  
*it will look better.*  
*it just feels natural, doesnt it?*

It was easy enough to ignore when lowercase was the domain of soundcloud rappers and tumblr fangirls. But now even Sam Altman does it! It's starting to resonate with the nerds! And that's around when I started to notice the pull.

And well...I couldn't really explain why we *needed* capital letters. I'd never thought about it, I suppose. It was just a thing people did. And I felt kind of silly. Of course Altman noticed that! The Startup Founder Slash Visionary who looks at the world differently, who sees what could be rather than what is! It's time to disrupt the capitalization, er, industry! Thai and Hebrew and Amharic don't use uppercase letters, why should I?

and then I read a 600 word substack essay written entirely in lowercase and my god, my eyes. i see the light. capitalization is good, actually. what the hell is altman thinking? [^1] please someone make it stop.

[^1]: A half-serious theory: it effectively gives him an extra communication channel. No capitalization means he's saying something he wants to say, capitalization means he's saying something he feels obligated or pressured to say. Proper capitalization is a wink at the reader: *you know I don't really mean this, but they can't nail me for it*.
