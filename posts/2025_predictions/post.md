# Predicting 2025

Last December I made a bunch of predictions about 2024. Some came true, some didn't, but mostly I don't remember them because I didn't write them down. So this time I want to record them. Partly so I can revisit this post a year from now and have some fun evaluating my past self's predictions, but also to force myself to crystallize some ideas that have been floating around my head for a while.

I intend to do precisely zero research for these predictions - they will be purely vibes-based. I'll attach probabilities so Future Me can evaluate how wrong I was, but don't let this fool you into assuming some level of rigor that's not there. I'll try to predict probabilities rather than quantities when possible to make evaluation simpler. My predictions will generally deal with one of three topics: myself, AI, and, uh, Other Stuff. Which I guess does kind of sum up how I see the world, and that's maybe not great, but 🤷‍♂️.

# Me
This is kind of a weird category: these are generally things I can control or at least influence dramatically. Maybe this section will end up halfway between goals and predictions, I don't know. But that's not necessarily my intent.

- *[67%] - I average >=2 posts per month.* At one point I had visions of churning out 1-2 posts per week but that seems unlikely, given my current rate of posting. And I also want to start devoting more time to hobby coding again, which fell off dramatically in June 2023. Twice a month sems like a reasonable and enjoyable target and I think it's fairly likely I stick with it.

- *[1%] - I break into a new V-grade in bouldering.* This would be a first. I started climbing in September 2022 and climbed my first VB, V0, V1, V2, V3, and V4 by end of year. Then in 2023 I climbed my first V5, V6, and V7. Progress slowed in 2024 but I still bagged my first V8. V9 is still ridiculously far away though, I think. Even repeating V8 is far from a given. At this point I've mostly embraced the surprising reality that I'm an overhang hater. (I initially got into climbing expecting to like overhangs, dynos, and campusing, and only the third turned out to be true.) And there just aren't many vert V9s, or even V8s. I do think V7s will start to come more frequently though. I've made some major breakthroughs around using body tension these last few months, and while this hasn't fully been reflected in my send stats, I think it will become more visible in the long run. The upshot of all this is that my climbing mindset needs to evolve. I've always consciously viewed grade chasing as dumb but my actions betray me. That won't work for much longer. But I think I'll be okay - unlike, say, lifting, you can still have satisfying breakthroughs day to day even while in a macro-plateau. (In this way climbing reminds me a bit of programming, and is probably a large part of why I like it - though still a far cry from the joy of actual coding.)

- *[60%] - My recreational spending jumps to >2x my current lifetime max.* For the record, 2024 produced my current max, and this was very nearly 2x my previous max which occurred in 2023. I don't view this as a bad thing: I started out so neurotic about money so I see this as gradually learning to let go. My aversion to spending has created certain inconveniences in my life that simply have no reason to exist at this point, and I think it's time to ameliorate this. I don't question that money has dramatically diminishing returns on wellbeing; I just suspect that my spot in the spending distribution leaves quite a bit of wellbeing to be reaped.

- *[37%] - My cooking skills improve by >>10%, as judged by me via a non-rigorous vibe check.* Improvements could manifest as increased variety and/or increased quality. 10% seems kind of small and hard to observe and I suspect 20% could leave me debating whether a moderate improvement was closer to 17% or 21%. So >>10% is really just a standin for "clearly quite a bit more than 10%, there are nontrivial improvements here". My preferred way to achieve this would be through the local community college's culinary program, but their classes consistently seem to lie during business hours and not in easy to workaround segments. (E.g. a noon-1pm class once a week would probably be fine, but 9am-1pm twice a week won't fly.) Letting Claude guide me through a customized lesson plan is another possibility, but I worry this is too easy to let slide when motivation wanes. A third option is Kitchen on Fire's 12 week in-person course, which feels rather wasteful given the cost and the fact LLMs exist, but maybe the financial commitment is what I need to ensure I stick with it. A likely failure mode here is that I can't decide about which option to go with and end up putting this on hold for another year - which wouldn't be a great outcome, but also not the worst thing in the world. Maybe eventually I'll just take a year off and churn through as many of those community college courses as I can.

- *[33%] - I travel somewhere that requires a plane, not for work.* Historically I've been a big travel skeptic. I'm more interested in marginally improving a regular weekday than trying to construct a few spectacular days per year. Life is mostly a series of mundane Tuesdays and so even a 5% improvement there can be transformative. The idea of living for the rare break from that routine...worries me a bit. But enough people are sufficiently taken with it that I think maybe I should give travel another try. But if I do, I want to do it my way. Which means I don't want to just consume - even if I'm looking at paintings at the Louvre or watching a play on Broadway or wandering through ruins in Rome, it still feels fundamentally passive in a way I don't really enjoy. If I travel I want to climb at B-Pump, or apprentice under some Italian pasta-maker like Aziz Ansari did both in real life and in Master of None, or learn to make shoes on Saville Row. Or...take a live David Beazley programming class in Chicago. Like Kitchen on Fire, the price is a bit eye-watering (I think the expectation is most students will expense it through their employer 😢), but it does sound pretty cool... If he brings back [The One](https://www.dabeaz.com/theone.html), I might be in.

- *[67%] - I will read more books than I did in 2024 (19).* I dialed down the reading a little bit in 2024 - I think I'd read too many books lately that I just didn't enjoy. I tried to be a little more selective and more honest about what I actually like. I want to continue curating aggressively (see below) but I also want to up the volume slightly again. The number may also inflate naturally since unlike 2024, 2025 will presumably not include a 1,600 page Sanderson monstrosity.

- *[58%] - I will maintain a Goodreads Satisfaction Rate of >= 75%.* I define Satisfaction Rate as the % of books I read that I assign >=4 stars out of 5. In recent years, it's been 71%, 25%, and 68% in that order. (I don't go back further because I used to rate a little more generously and don't want to revise all those ratings now; even 2022's 71% might be slightly inflated. Also, what the hell was I doing in 2023?) I'm not sure if I've ever hit 75% (at least not as an adult) but it feels within reach. For some reason 80% sounds way harder though. Perhaps this prediction will nudge me to choose a little more thoughfully. For the record, I'd much rather this prediction be correct than the previous one about volume.

# AI

Historically my predictions have been pretty good here, but I haven't tracked this rigorously or assigned probabilities very consistently. So we'll see...

TODO
- some possible points to consider and make more concrete: agents have their breakthrough moment, GUI usage improvements accelerate real world impact, people become increasingly disillusioned with benchmarks and start to rethink eval methods, new arch/method that generates >1 token per forward pass speeds up inference by ~OOM, we're able to run O1 level model on a regular macbook, SWE-bench approaches saturation but real world perf lags, (low prob) coding interviews change dramatically, alignment/safety teams (not counting interp) fail to make meaningful leap forward, AI companions remain (to me) disappointing due to lack of stakes, lud movement grows significantly (need to figure out how to quantify)

# Other

- *[70%] - Janja Garnbret climbs her first V17 outdoors.* She recently announced she'll be sitting out most of the indoor season to focus on outdoor climbing, which was largely met with excitement from the climbing community. I was one of the few exceptions. Indoor comp climbing careers are short and it frustrates me how rarely we get to see the elite climbers actually compete head to head. (Despite Janja's perceived dominance, Natalia has won the last three IFSC world cups! Granted Janja was injured for part of that time but that's still kind of crazy to me.) The silver lining is that I do expect Janja to put up some crazy sends outdoors - in fact, I think she may be better suited to challenge the men there than indoors, where explosiveness could be an issue. So yes, I'm predicting she sends both V16 and V17 this year. Another hot take is that she will eventually send >=V18, though I don't think she'll be the first and I wouldn't bet on it coming this year. Bosi, though...

- *[35%] - Jon Jones fights Tom Aspinall to unify the UFC Heavyweight belts.* I know Dana recently guaranteed this will happen, but I'm just not convinced. Jon doesn't sound particularly interested in the fight, and I don't buy that it's all some 4D chess negotiation tactic (for all his brilliance inside the cage, the way he's navigated his career and, well, everything outside the cage hasn't been particularly shrewd). That doesn't mean he wouldn't win if they fought - I'm not even going to speculate on that right now. For what it's worth, I'm kind of more interested to see Jones vs Ngannou, Ngannou vs Aspinall, or Pereira vs somebody for the heavyweight belt. But the Jones-Aspinall fight is growing on me. I just don't know that it happens.
