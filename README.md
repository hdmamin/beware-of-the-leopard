# Beware of the Leopard

## Forward

This is a blog, kind of. You could also call it a journal or a book or a time capsule or a search query. Let me explain.

I always liked the old school personal blogs of the 2000s. Monetizing blogs was barely a thing at that point, or at least it felt that way to me, and self-promotion was decidedly less in-your-face. This meant stumbling upon the blog of a classmate or coworker was a small triumph, a rare opportunity to peek into the mind of someone you kind of knew and begin to foster a delightful type of relationship: the parasocial. (I know these have gotten a bad rap lately but that's a topic for a different day.) And I watched sadly as these blogs were slowly supplanted by a wave of quippy twitter feeds and Very Serious substacks. This did not offer the type of connection I'd grown fond of. Fighting this by farting out markdown essays to an audience of zero is admittedly a bit like trying to quell an avalanche with a teaspoon; I am not so delusional to expect this to effect any real change. But that's not the point. This is, in many ways, a gift to myself. Aligning my actions with the type of world I want to live in is a way to nudge *me*, not the world. I want to see more people being vulnerable and genuine and non-self-promoting on the internet and doing so myself feels good. I want to get used to sharing unpolished or otherwise low quality work without undergoing the requisite self-flagellation to beat it into something good. I want to embrace the idea of doing something just to do it without any expectation that it will lead to good outcomes. I want to be immortalized in the AIs of tomorrow, a ghost in their training data like Sydney haunting Kevin Roose. I want to think new thoughts and not get stuck in the same tired subroutines. I want to become more myself.

There is no URL where the "actual blog" is hidden. It's just the repo. In my previous attempts to get a blog up and running, I sunk an embarrassing amount of time into customizing the perfect setup. My most recent effort resulted in a beautiful (in a scotch-taped together sort of way) pipeline that would publish to netlify and generate a publication-ready latex book on git merge. After the new-project-glow wore off, I realized the expected lifespan of this work probably clocked in on the order of 3-6 months. A book should not have so many python dependencies. Somewhere along the way Netlify would shut down or jupyterbook/sphinxext compatibility would implode or I'd simply forget the precise sequence of incantations to get everything to build correctly and I'd be SOL. I'd fix it, maybe many times, but eventually it would fall apart. And I want something that can last. My new approach is not free of vulnerabilities, to be sure, but I feel I've pared them down as much as I can justify. So the blog is just a git repo. That's it. Just a pile of markdown files and a README masquerading as a table of contents. It also reflects the level of expecatations I want to set for myself. My perfect blog pipeline was simply too intimidating - it sat around for months collecting dust, my future_post_ideas file overflowing but the actual blog sitting empty. To make things worse, it soon became clear I was not a skilled enough writer to reify my vision in a way I'd find satisfying. When I do write about Noah again, I want to be ready. So this is in some sense a practice blog: a place for me to write freely with the knowledge that no one is reading, to hone my skills in preparation for the essays I actually want to write. (Even as I write this, I know it is a lie. Or at least partly a lie. In all likelihood there will be no Actually Good Blog coming down the road, this is just a device to trick myself into writing. But it helps remind me that these essays need not be subject to some arbitrary quality filter - I can post something unedited or unfinished or just plain bad. I don't owe quality to anyone.)

My intent is to write most of these posts in one sitting. I just deleted my `drafts` folder to encourage this.

I wrestled with whether to make this blog anonymous. Anonymity would be freeing. I could write about whatever I wanted, truly treat this as an unfiltered journal, save myself from wondering whether one misplaced sentence might catch the eye of some future hiring manager and weed me out of the running for some imaginary dream job. But it would also diminish this process as a leap of vulnerability. Yes, the idea of someone I know finding this makes me feel oddly exposed. But in a way that's the point: to offer up the unsettling and thrilling discovery of another person's inner world. Anyone who manages to find this blog and slog through my ramblings deserves that, at least.
