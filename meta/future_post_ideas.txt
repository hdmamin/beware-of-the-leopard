- why is book experience less valuable than firsthand experience and how could we make them better?
  - Recall claims about 'you can't speedrun jr->staff eng by reading, you just have to learn by experience'
  - isn't firsthand experience sort of overfitting to a small biased sample?
  - initial guesses:
      - real experience brings nuances/details that are hard to fully convey in books (somewhat skeptical of this)
      - book lessons don't stick as much because there's no emotion/experience attached. E.g. "don't write unnecessarily complex code" is a much weaker teacher than "my stupid decorator brought down prod and I'm worried about losing my job"

- communication as autoencoder
  - thought in my head, want thought in your head. Need to go thought -> spoken language -> heard language -> thought
  - maybe tie in comm strategies like repeating back what you heard

- tests that are hard to create (wording isn't quite right there but I'll elaborate)
  - chollet tried really hard to make ARC unsolvable by pattern matching/memorization, but looks like LLMs still might crack it. More generally, if it's so difficult to define a test that requires "true intelligence" then maybe it's not actually that useful a distinction. I.e. if the only room that exists is the chinese room, it's just a room.
  - (can't tell if this is exactly the same concept yet but it feels related, and there's pun potential here) if setters dramatically nerf moves to try to ensure that Ai Mori can do them, and yet she still can't but everyone else can, then maybe that means she's just worse at climbing along some dimensions. Like if it's this hard to create artificial parity between everyone, then maybe that parity doesn't exist and this is just useful separation.

- writing on the internet as a path to immortality
  - rather than trying to avoid LLMs "stealing" your work, maybe see this as an opp to be represented in future AIs

- embracing doing things badly as a way to prep for a potential AI future
  - wrote less and less bc value of writing seemed to be dropping quickly. But this also led to worse, more boring, more limited thoughts on my end, generally worse wellbeing. Risky to place too much self value in being better than machines at something.
  - probably touch on code here too, similar dynamic
  - reluctance to write a bad Noah post delays me from making any progress at all

- offloading more writing to LLMs means fewer, lower quality thoughts?
  - some (e.g. paul graham) argue writing is necessary for clear thinking. What does that mean if we start writing less and less?
  - possible tie ins: getting caught in the same thought coroutines/relying on cached thoughts, personalities as being defined by our interactions with other people

- loneliness and social graph influence
  - recall ezra klein idea of thinking of yourself as a node in a social graph, your behavior is a mechanism to effect change
  - this makes it harder for isolated people to create a future they'd want to live in or one they'd thrive in - they are un-influential nodes in the graph
  - possible tie ins: boltzmann brains (and perhaps LLMs) and the feeling of flickering back into existence when socializing/writing

- the unsatsifyingness of character.ai and similar chat systems
  - was psyched for Her-like tech, once it arrived found it profoundly uninteresting (granted, maybe our systems are lagging a bit behind, but still seems like they should be more compelling than they are)
  - ezra klein's hypothesis re lack of stakes seems pretty compelling, but think more about if that really explains MY behavior here
  - podcasts fill this role much better for me
  - friendship is a communication of your worth, "you are a good person", "you are worth spending time with". They can abandon you but they don't, they can use your vulnerability to hurt you but they choose not to. It means nothing if the AI can't abandon you, is compelled to be kind. But it's a tricky balance, if the AI is too cruel then of course noone would want to spend time with it either (outside of some kind of gimmicky roasting appeal).

- what makes a good teacher
  - my main claim: getting you excited about a subject
  - possible tie ins: why does school suck so much and how can we make it suck less? (I.e. most people in it hate it and seem to retain little)

- the joy of SWE for a target user of 1
  - everything feels meaningful/important bc you prioritized it according to your needs, you see direct immediate payoff by using your new feature
  - possible tie ins: writing a blog no one else will read

- I miss gpt3, or An apology to hipsters
  - basically the idea that early base models were cool and alien and exciting, but with enough limitations to not worry to deeply about imminent job loss or x-risk
  - and bc only a few weirdos were paying attention, this was a powerful filter - whenever I met someone else who was obsessed with them it was reliably an invigorating experience. Now this signal is mostly nonexistant, culturally feels much more like bumping into one of a sea of bitcoin bros even though I think this comparison undersells the real potential. Or in other circles it's just more saas software, like talking about databases (much less exciting)

 - jenny and the power of showing excitement when greeting people
  - recall 10 year reunion, how did she end up on the list of people I was excited to see? Oh right

- reading: only like harry potter
  - only fun when wrapped in 11 layers of nostalgia
  - why is this so elevated as this intellectual pursuit? Still fundamentally just consumption, writing seems clearly far better and more stimulating (guess: writing is hard, reading is easy)
  - recall metaphor about eating unseasoned raw broccoli or something, then eating gas station pizza once. Not fine dining but good enough to ruin any interest in regular food.

- problems with consequentialism
  - mainly: IRL when do you ever have a good forecast of expected value?
  - scope of virtue ethics is far more manageable. How will this affect the person *I* am?

- LLM forecasting
  - promise: convert computation into knowledge of the future
  - possible tie-ins: maybe part of a larger post on non-writing assistant llm applications I'm excited about. E.g. massive scale dating/friend simulator to find good matches all over the globe, psychological experiments (requires great ability to generalize out of domain though), RLAIF to shape human personalities, roleplaying future trajectories based on past journal entries.

- being an introverted michael scott
  - i.e. someone who is desperate for acceptance and connection but incapable of it, and who turns inward rather than outward
  - possible tie in: manager quote about stars ("they shine and everyone can see it") vs box (unclear if metaphor was "star in a box" or "treasure chest" or what).

- the joy of overheard compliments
  - anecodote: gg and behan
  - no question of authenticity, no awkardness of accepting it gracefully

- liking people who are infuriating to like
  - Skip the Small Talk - realized I can quite often relate to and have a nice time talking to a certain type of nerdy, shy, therapy-ridden person. But because we're both so neurotic and rejection-averse, maintaining actual longterm relationships with them is hard.

- why do people like travel so much?
  - memoryless travel; recall rl/mt both found it profoundly unappealing, but couldn't describe any lasting impact memoryfull travel had on them
  - impact of 10% better travel vs 10% better avg tuesday. But people work so hard on optimizing travel.
  - vacation into "being a different person" would be cool
  - theory: expands your "circles" and gives you more visceral connections to other places. Like I already recognize that giving money to a charity that helps underprivileged people in some poor part of Ghana is a Good Thing but how likely am I to actually do it? Vs if you've been to Ghana, you have this highly specific memory that animates this act: "this is for Aboagye and his people, they were so kind to me and their food was really tasty"

- where are all the Ready Player One contests?
  - not VR, I mean why aren't there more childless people making their will a game/contest/lottery?
  - possible tie ins: more ambitious/creative suicide notes. LLMs should open a lot of doors here.

- collecting people (like the monk from way of kings prime)
  - this is a fascinating framing that made me way more interested in people and (hopefully?) more socially skilled
  - recall story of coworker and beekeeping: finding the most interesting version of a person

- questions where the process of answering them is destructive, i.e. reduces your ability to make use of that knowledge
  - e.g. leaving GG for big tech, or (I imagine) having kids
  - recall philosopher (LA something?) who talked about life-changing decisions and having to consider what the right choice is for both current you and post-decision you
  - does only the realized future you's happiness/wellbeing matter? Or does the counterfactual you deserve consideration?

- is "consult your doctor" just overfitting?
  - recall vaccine advice from recent dr. Is it really more advisable to trust that over a wider review of medical consensus?
  - possible tie ins: the "learning from experience" topic has a similar overfitting concern, maybe there's something related there

- mirror markets: e.g. linkedin/tinder, where participants play opposite roles
    - might work better if I find more examples, i.e. if there is something to abstract here rather than a single example. Or maybe the anomolousness of the single example makes it weirder and more interesting.

- overlistening and the joy of silence
    - that feeling where I've been listening to music/podcasts etc nonstop and then finally stop

- my number fixations
    - from "counting colors" as a kid, inadvertently computing powers of 2, lifting numbers (lift gains, weight gains/losses, weeks til cut/bulk ends), salary, years til leave job
    - really hard to find a positive number to fixate on. "how many compliments I gave today"?

- free time for the single adult
    - expected to be really busy as an adult. Instead, the problem is endless amounts of time that I'm not very good at filling.

- why are dating profiles so uninformative?  
    - multimodal search query for the most important person you'll ever meet
    - but so many tell you nothing? 1 word answers, answers that state the obvious "I want a partner who is kind", answers that give you no sense of where someone lies on a distribution "likes going out and also staying in"
    - possible explanations: incompetence or lack of effort, maintaining a wide net bc recall is more important than precision for most here, ???
    - how many people sit down and picture themselves as the type of person they're looking to attract and write sample responess to each prompt/photo on their profile? Seems like it should be standard practice but seems like basically noone does this?
    - semi-related: many people dislike bad photos or bad profiles but this seems like potentially a good strategy for finding underrated people. I.e. there will be massive competition for a desirable person with a great profile. A bad profile means higher chance of finding a diamond in the rough. Much better than shitty person with a good profile. (Though I guess the risk is "low effort profile -> low effort partner". Which could be true but I'm guessing noone's really tried to test that claim.)

- remembering noah mckee
    - his reaction to "the sleeve" in square dancing and how he sort of became my model of an emotionally healthy person
    - how depression-ridden our soccer crew was - 1 suicide, 1 on antidepressants with a suicide attempt, 1 whose brother committed suicide, 1 who spent years on the verge of it 😬, and who knows what the others were silently dealing with
    - how different a vibe some of the pictures gave off - like I knew this tiny slice of Noah and I'm sad I didn't get to meet the other hims
        - the funny contrast between the sensitive musician he seemed to have become and the wild-haired "3 goals and a red card, baby" guy I remember
    - mostly, the way he just treated me like a regular person. Sometimes feel like people approach me with kid gloves, or like they don'twant to spook a wild deer. Which is understandable because I am shy and awkward and easily spooked. But it's like he didn't notice anything was different about me, or if he did he didn't care, and it went a long way towards making me feel more normal and likable.
    - the way most of the suicides that happened in high school didn't affect me, or didn't feel like they did, so I almost felt weirdly inoculated, like suicides couldn't really hurt me. And then learning about noah and having that narrative unravel.
    - the oddness of learning about a suicide with such a delay. He died 9/21/19, and I don't think I learned of it til maybe 2+ years later.

- when someone leaving means losing a version of yourself (RH, realized my fav version of myself may be gone)

- putting unfinished things out into the world as a means of motivation to make it better
    - idea: auto publish one blog post every week/month/etc to avoid the trap of never publishing
    - making a bad dating profile to make me want to make a better one. Or making one before I'm actually ready to date because matching with someone might motivate me to actually do what is needed to *become* ready.
